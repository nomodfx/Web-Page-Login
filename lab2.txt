The project is complete with no bugs from what I can see.

//lab2.php
This is a simple login file for normal users that allows them to login into an existing account or register. 

//db_connect.php
The script that connects to the database. The default XAMPP settings for localhost and phpMyAdmin were used. 

//register.php
Stores new user information and inserts into users table. For simple validation, ignores slashes,escape characters, special characters from username and password string inputs.
Rejects registration with exisitng usernames and prevents duplication of admin user info. 

//welcome.php
Sends user to a welcome page with a welcome message followed by their username upon successful login. Allows users toggle background color to blue, ability to logout while redirecting them back to lab2(login) page.

//admin.php
This is a form similar to lab2.php that allows only an admin user to login. I manually added this user on mysql database. 
For my project, the admin credentials are userId='1', username='admin', password='1234'. It sends them to the special welcome page that displays users table.

//welcomeAdmin.php
Similar to welcome.php but is only accessible to admin user only. Welcomes that user with a welcome message and displays table along with user ids, usernames, passwords. The table is ordered by username. 
Ability to toggle background color to blue and logout back to lab2.php.

//lab2.sql
Contains a sql dump of the lab2 database and the users table.

//Extra credit
I made an attempt with hashing the passwords using md5 to create random unique hashes.
